Input commands are to be written as new lines into instructions_input.txt

If commands include additional arguments, they should be on the same line 
following the command and separated by commas. 
For example, the below command has three arguments:

SomeCommand,SomeArgument,Another Argument,AThirdArgument

--sent after acquisition of single image stack complete--
command: GrabOneStackDone
arguments: path to newly acquired image stack 
example: GrabOneStackDone c:/images/acq1/image1.tiff

--sent after movement to new coordinates is complete--
command = StageMoveDone
arguments: x, y, z
example: StageMoveDone,1,34.2,-2

--sent after request for current position--
command = CurrentPosition
arguments: x, y, z
example: CurrentPosition,2,0,-3.2

--sent after uncaging is finished--
command = UncagingDone
arguments: None
example: UncagingDone

--sent to establish Field of View size in Âµm (when completely zoomed out)--
command = fovXY_um
arguments = X,Y
example: fovXY_um,250,250

--sent when new zoom is set--
command = Zoom
arguments = zoomvalue
example: Zoom,25


Output commands are written line by line to instructions_output.txt

command = moveXYZ
arguments: x y z
example: moveXYZ,12,89.2,0
expected return command: StageMoveDone

--Grab a stack once--
command = grabOneStack
arguments: None
example: grabOneStack
expected return command: GrabOneStackDone

--Set Zoom to specific value
command = setZoom
arguments: zoom
example: setZoom,20
expected return command: Zoom

--Do uncaging--
command = runUncaging
arguments: None
example: runUncaging
expected return command: UncagingDone

--Request for current position to be sent--
command = getCurrentPosition
arguments: None
example: getCurrentPosition
expected return command: CurrentPosition

--Request for FOV size--
command = getFOV_xy
arguments: None
example: getFOV_xy
expected return command: fovXY_um
